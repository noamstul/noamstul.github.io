          <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Noam, and I am an interactive media designer. I grew up right here in a quiet neighbourhood in Ottawa, but I eventually found my way to Toronto, where I completed my post-secondary schooling. I studied cognitive science at York University, where I learned all about the mind, brain, and how the two are connected.</p>
          <p>After my brief time in Toronto, I decided to come back to my home town of Ottawa and get some work experience under my belt. I then spent the next two years working as a financial advisor for TD, for which I had to learn the inner workings of the banking industry and obtain my mutual funds license. I loved helping my clients, but I still wanted to work in a more creatively fulfilling industry. That's when I decided to enroll in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College in Ottawa.</p>
          <p>I've spent the last year learning a brand new skillset. This program has been an invaluable experience for me, as I've had to learn many new skills, and adapt to innumerable new challenges almost every day. As an interactive media designer, I am expected to be able to adapt to new problems, and come up with bespoke solutions to them.</p>
          <p>I'm extremely proud of what I've accomplished this year. I've learned so much in such a short time about interactive media. Why don't you check out my portfolio page to see for yourself?</p>
