                    <h2>Algonquin College Recreation Centre Redesign</h2>
                    <p>For my midterm this semester, I was tasked with developing a site for the new Algonquin College Recreation Centre. The design was given to my class by the instructor, and we had to recreate it faithfully using only HTML and CSS.</p>
                    <p>This project forced me to master new concepts in web design, including animations and responsive images. It also made me break some of the habits I had developed in coding, and forced me to consider mobile, tablet, and desktop versions of the site while developing. Here's a screenshot of the site, but why don't you click the link and navigate the site for yourself?</p>

                    <p>This semester, I also learned the ins and outs of Bootstrap, an open-source web development framework. I created a site with some tips and tricks on using bootstrap, and of course, I used exclusively HTML and Bootstrap to code it. Check it out using the link below.</p>

                    <p>While we only take one class on digital graphics in the Interactive Media Design (IMD) program, I did have the chance to learn how to use some of Adobe's coolest tools: Illustrator and Photoshop.
                    </p>
                    <p>My first major assignment was to design a vector graphic of an animal using Adobe Illustrator, similar to what you might see as an application icon. I chose to design a happy little frog, and I provided 3 different sized icons for different sized devices. the vector graphics are below.</p>

                        <p>My final project for Adobe Photoshop, on the other hand, had me making a sci-fi movie poster. The catch for this one is that I had to include an image of myself within the poster. A picture is worth a thousand words, so why don't I just let you see for yourself.</p>

                    <p>In my photography class I learned the basics of using a DSLR and shooting in manual mode. We dove into the relationship between ISO, aperture, and shutterspeed, and practiced shooting portraits, architecture, nature, and macro photography. We also covered the process of post-production, using editing software such as Photoshop and Lightroom to make alterations to our original images. While I was a complete novice to photography prior to taking this class, my skills greatly improved by the end of it. Pictured below are some of the images I have taken since then.</p>

                    <p>I have also had the chance to learn the foundations and theories of video production. In this class, we studied different techniques and practices that are used across all levels of film productions, from simple YouTube videos to large scale multi-camera productions. While we covered a lot of theory, we also received hands-on practice in making our own videos.</p>

                    <p>In order to create the vlog-style videos for our final project, I had to write, record, edit, and post-produce the two videos all by myself. I used the equipment that I had available to me in my home to create proper lighting, audio, and video. Feel free to watch the end results below.</p>

                    <p>User experience taught me the fundamentals of good design. User experience turned out to be rather important, as I learned how to develop with the user in mind, and not just the developer. After all, you want to make sure that the user has a good experience on your website, otherwise no one will want to use it!</p>
                    <h2>Bad Website Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>No, I didn't make a bad prototype for a website. Rather, I took a website that looked old and staledated, and that didn't have a proper mobile or tablet version, and gave it a fresh and modern look. If you'd like to get a feel for what I mean, I've included a link to the original website, and a link to view my Adobe Xd redesign.</p>

                    <h2>Shopify</h2>
                    <p>While we also covered Wordpress and Drupal in this class, the CMS that stuck with me was Shopify. Not only did I find it incredibly user-friendly, but I also enjoyed the freedom that it offers the user, and the ease with which you can create a stylish and completely functional online store. Not only that, but the behind-the-scenes technology is amazing as well. Shopify provides incredible data for its users, and I loved the fact that I could easily take into account, shipping, the original cost of the item, the weight of the items, etc., and use all that information to track the profitability of my store.</p>
                    <p>Check out my Shopify store below. It's a play on ebay.</p>
