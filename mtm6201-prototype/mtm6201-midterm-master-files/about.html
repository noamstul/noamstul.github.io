                        is ARC? We are the Athletics & Recreation Centre. This is an exciting venture for our Algonquin Community.  This facility will provide our students with a place to break through perceptual barriers in a welcoming, safe, inclusive and inviting environment for students of all backgrounds, cultures and abilities to spark a movement.
