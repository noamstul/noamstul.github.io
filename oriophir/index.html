                    <h2>Ryn Aether</h2>
                    <p>Born and raised in Oriophir, he's the ship's quartermaster who always keeps them on course. He's been a crewmember for 8 years now, whose oldest friend on the ship is first mate Kiprix.</p>

                    <h2>Winry</h2>
                    <p>Winry trained in the local monastery for years before her mother was taken from her. Unfortunately, her holy skills were unable to bring her mother back from the beyond. She has worked on the Windancer as the ship's medic ever since.</p>

                    <h2>Romeo</h2>
                    <p>Romeo's lifelong goal is to make his parents proud. He has yet to achieve this goal, but hopes to do so by impressing everyone on the Windancer with his meals as the chef. He's also learning to be a man from his friend Draseth.</p>

                    <h2>Lily and Poko</h2>
                    <p>Lily may seem like an odd fit on the ship, but she is a highly powerful warlock, though she doesn't know it. Only ten years old, yet she performs the integral Talif barrier ceremony for the crew, allowing them to enter Oriophir. She and her monkey familiar Poko get up to all sorts of mischief on the Wind Dancer.</p>

                    <p>Nara serves as the master gunner on the Wind Dancer. While she's not preparing ammunition for the ship's ballistae, she is plotting revenge for the murder of her family.</p>

                    <p>While Draseth grew up in the afluent, Archon-inhabited district of Oriophir, he doesn't like to talk much about his past. He's fiercely loyal to his friends, and always enjoys a good joke.</p>

                    <p>Kiprix, the longest serving member of the crew other than Captain Darius himself, is the First Mate of the ship. While the crew likes to give him a hard time, making fun of his age and alleged senility, he knows that the crew ultimately respect him and will follow his orders.</p>
