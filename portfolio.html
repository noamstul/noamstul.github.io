                    <p>During the summer of 2020, I had the honour of joining a group of
                        talented design freelancers called Freelancer Media Group (FMG). My
                        first job with them was to fully redesign an Ottawa-based caterer’s
                        website.</p>
                    <p>The job had me build the site from the ground up, and I accomplished
                        this using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The site is mobile friendly, and
                        has been tested across many different browsers and devices.
                        The redesign brought his website into the modern age, and has allowed
                        many happy customers to peruse pictures of his cuisine at
                        home or on the go.</p>

                    <p>For my midterm this semester, I was tasked with developing a site for the new Algonquin College Recreation Centre. The design was given to my class by the instructor, and we had to recreate it faithfully using only HTML and CSS.</p>
                    <p>This project forced me to master new concepts in web design, including animations and responsive images. It also made me break some of the habits I had developed in coding, and forced me to consider mobile, tablet, and desktop versions of the site while developing. Here's a screenshot of the site, but why don't you click the link and navigate the site for yourself?</p>

                    <h2>Fruit Scramble</h2>
                    <p>I built Fruit Scramble as my midterm project for my Web Production
                        class in my final semester at Algonquin College. I utilized Vue, a
                        JavaScript framework, to build a word scramble game that has the
                        player guess a scrambled word. The player must guess all 10 words
                        correctly before getting three wrong in order to win the game. They
                        also start with 3 skips that they can use if they are stuck on a word.</p>
                    <p>
                        The game doesn’t experience any refreshes, and it saves the user’s
                        progress. If they close the browser or refresh the page, they will be
                        able to jump right back into the fun without having to restart the
                        game.

                    <h2>Clock</h2>
                    <p>In learning JavaScript, I built a clock application that display’s NASA’s
                        Astronomical Photo of the Day (APOD). The application retrieves
                        the APOD with the help of NASA’s API. Working with the JavaScript
                        Date object, I built the application with a simple and clean interface to
                        maximize the brilliance of the APOD.</p>
                    <p>The application allows the user to toggle the year and timezone, and
                        it also gives them the ability to change the display to a dark mode or
                        retro theme. Not only that, but any changes to the settings that the
                        user makes will be saved, and if they return to the app or refresh the
                        page, their previous settings will be retained.</p>

                    <h2>Shopify</h2>
                    <p>During my second year of the IMD program, I built a couple of test
                        sites revolving around a business concept I had for a board game
                        subscription service called Tabletop Box. The service would ship new
                        board games to subscribers every month based on a tiered subscription
                        service. The service would provide discounts to board game afficionados
                        who would receive new board games from partnering game
                        companies every month.</p>
                    <p>I build this version of the site using Shopify. I used Liquid to customize
                        various aspects of the site, and installed plugins like a map and a
                        checkout cart to provide functionality to the site.</p>
