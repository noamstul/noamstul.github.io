                    <p>During the summer of 2020, I had the honour of joining a group of talented design freelancers called Freelancer Media Group (FMG). My first job with them was to fully redesign an Ottawa-based caterer's website. The job had me build the site from the ground up, and it threw quite a few challenges my way. I managed to overcome them, and and I am very pleased with how the final product turned out.</p>

                    <h2>Algonquin College Recreation Centre Redesign</h2>
                    <p>For my midterm this semester, I was tasked with developing a site for the new Algonquin College Recreation Centre. The design was given to my class by the instructor, and we had to recreate it faithfully using only HTML and CSS.</p>
                    <p>This project forced me to master new concepts in web design, including animations and responsive images. It also made me break some of the habits I had developed in coding, and forced me to consider mobile, tablet, and desktop versions of the site while developing. Here's a screenshot of the site, but why don't you click the link and navigate the site for yourself?</p>

                         </p>
                        <p>My first major assignment was to design a vector graphic of an animal using Adobe Illustrator, similar to what you might see as an application icon. I chose to design a happy little frog, and I provided 3 different sized icons for different sized devices. the vector graphics are below.</p>

We dove into the relationship between ISO, aperture, and shutterspeed, and practiced shooting portraits, architecture, nature, and macro photography. We also covered the process of post-production, using editing software such as Photoshop and Lightroom to make alterations to our original images. While I was a complete novice to photography prior to taking this class, my skills greatly improved by the end of it. Pictured below are some of the images I have taken since then.</p>

                    <p>While we also covered Wordpress and Drupal in this class, the CMS that stuck with me was Shopify. Not only did I find it incredibly user-friendly, but I also enjoyed the freedom that it offers the user, and the ease with which you can create a stylish and completely functional online store. Not only that, but the behind-the-scenes technology is amazing as well. Shopify provides incredible data for its users, and I loved the fact that I could easily take into account shipping, the original cost of the item, the weight of the items, etc., and use all that information to track the profitability of my store.</p>
